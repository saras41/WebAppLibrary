Library Management System Project (HCL Internship)
Overview: The Library Management System was designed to streamline the management of books, members, and borrowing activities in a library. This project aimed to digitize manual processes, making library operations more efficient and user-friendly.

Key Features:

Administrator Module:

Add, update, delete, and view book details.
Manage library members, including adding new members and updating member profiles.
Generate reports on book inventory and borrowed books.
Library Member Module:

Search for books by title, author, or genre.
View borrowing history and due dates.
Request book renewals or reservations.
Search Functionality:

Advanced search options to filter books based on category, availability, or publication date.
Book Borrowing and Return:

Track issued and returned books with timestamps.
Manage overdue penalties automatically based on predefined rules.
Authentication and Role-Based Access:

Secure login for admins and members.
Different user roles to ensure proper access control.
Database Management:

Centralized database to store books, members, and transaction records.
Optimized queries to ensure quick retrieval of information.
Tools and Technologies Used:

Frontend: HTML, CSS.
Backend: ASP.NET or C#
Database: MySQL/MSSQL for storing records.
IDE: Visual Studio 
Version Control: GitHub for collaboration and version tracking.
Project Workflow:

Requirement Gathering: Collaborated with mentors and library staff to identify pain points in the manual system.
Design Phase: Created mockups and database schemas.
Development: Implemented features in modules to ensure modularity and easy debugging.
Testing: Conducted unit and integration testing to ensure system reliability.
Deployment: Deployed the system on a local server and provided training to end users.
Challenges Faced:

Ensuring database integrity during simultaneous operations (e.g., borrowing and returning books).
Designing a user-friendly interface that could be easily navigated by non-technical users.
Implementing a robust search algorithm for accurate and quick results.
Learning Outcomes:

Gained hands-on experience in software development life cycle (SDLC).
Enhanced problem-solving skills by addressing real-world challenges in library management.
Improved knowledge of database management and query optimization.
Strengthened coding skills and ability to debug complex systems.
